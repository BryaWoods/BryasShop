# E-Commerce Web Application

## Description of the Project

This project involves enhancing an existing e-commerce application, EasyShop, which serves as an online store. Your primary role will be as a backend developer, focusing on updating and expanding the functionality of the backend server, which uses a Spring Boot API with a MySQL database

## User Stories
- As a backend developer, I want to identify and fix bugs in the existing API code so that the application functions correctly without errors. Acceptance Criteria: Bugs are identified using manual debugging and unit tests. All identified bugs are fixed. Existing functionality is verified to work as expected.
- As a user I want to search for products by name or category so that I can easily find the products I am looking for.
- As a user, I want to register an account on EasyShop so that I can make purchases and track my orders.
- As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my account and saved cart.
- As a user, I want to add products to a shopping cart so that I can review my selections before making a purchase.
- As a user, I want to complete a purchase by checking out so that I can buy the products in my shopping cart.
